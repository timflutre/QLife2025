# Genomic prediction for quantitative traits

See the file `genpred.qmd`:

1. open it in RStudio 

2. run the simulations in the terminal

3. click on `Render`

By default, the computations are cached.
If you want to re-run all chunks, put `cache` at `false` in the YAML header.

It is also possible to run the whole file in a terminal with this command-line:
```
quarto render genpred.qmd --to html
```



# GWAS for quantitative traits

Same but with the file `gwas.qmd`.
