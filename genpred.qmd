# Main objective

The goal of this session is to show how to answer the question "how to replace pedigree-based kinship with SNP-based kinship?".



# Load all the data

```{r}
2+2
```



# First goal: understand the genetic determinism of complex traits

## Compare GRMs

* expected IBD matrix (pedigree); R/pedigremm

* realized IBD matrix (lineages); generated by the Python script

* VanRaden; R code Tim

* Speed (LDAK)

```{r}
2+2
```

## Estimate variance components

R/sommer

```{r}
2+2
```



# Second goal: predict the breeding values of non-phenotyped individuals

R/rrBLUP (or R/sommer)

```{r}
2+2
```


# Appendix

```{r}
print(sessionInfo(), locale=FALSE)
```
