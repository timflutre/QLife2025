# Main objective

The goal of this session is to show how to answer the question "how to replace pedigree-based kinship with SNP-based kinship?".



# First goal: understand the genetic determinism of complex traits

```{r}
2+2
```


# Second goal: predict the breeding values of non-phenotyped individuals

```{r}
2+2
```

# Appendix
